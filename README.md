# TechnicalTaskForCompany
Technical task which was supplied by a company for me to complete and upload to a public github repo.

Written in Python3, this will be required to run the program.
To run the main component of the code which answers questions use:
'''
python3 zynstra_questions.py 75  
'''
To specify a candidate number
Or use without specifying a candidate number, which will default to the number which I was provided with
'''
python3 zynstra_questions.py
'''

Furthermore, to run the tests on this code, use:
'''
python3 testing_code.py
'''
